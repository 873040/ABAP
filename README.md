# abap-platform-ci-cd-samples
This repository contains sample configurations for the ABAP Environment specific steps and pipelines of the piper project.

## Description
The first section of your file should start with the description of your project. Describe your project, why it exists, what it should provide to the user, and what differentiates it from any other project available.
The 1-2 sentence description used to create the project is the minimum requirement, but more text is preferred. The expectation is that the developer who reads this can use this text to determine if this project is the correct software for their needs and goals.
If your project is in an early stage and is not yet ready to be used productively, please mention this explicitly.
## Requirements
-> https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/
## Download and Installation
Describe, in detail, how the project should be downloaded and installed.
The developer can assume that the user will know how to clone or download a project. If a binary or installer is included, this should be described (and links used to the file).
The installation instructions should be bootstrap instructions, in other words, they should start from a clean slate and complete when the software is ready for use. Please be as specific as possible, and the team is encouraged to use images and other documentation to make this section complete. Do not take shortcuts that assume the user will be in the correct directory or have specific installation tools available (except where those were listed specifically in the requirements section.)
Note: This section is the most likely to fail the review cycle. Please review it carefully. 
## Configuration
Many open-source projects also contain configuration options. These options may not be part of the installation process, but help configure the source for specific uses. This section should contain detailed notes of the configuration options, and how each option works.
Note: Many teams choose to put large configuration sections in a separate file, with a link from this section. This is perfectly acceptable and recommended for large configuration sections.
[Optional] This section may be omitted if there are no configuration options, or if all configuration is done and documented in the installation instructions.
## Known Issues
Please list all known issues, or bugs, here. Even if the project is provided "as-is" any known problems should be listed.
How to obtain support
This section should contain details on how the outside user can obtain support, ask questions, or post a bug report on your project.
For example, if your project allows and expects users to post questions or bug reports in the GitHub bug tracking system, put that information here. If your team is also monitoring another website for questions (for example, the SAP Q&A, or StackOverflow), that should also be listed.
If your project is provided "as-is", with no expected changes or support, you must state that here.
